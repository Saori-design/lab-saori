      <p class="Mystory  center-this">Hello, everyone. I’m Saori(I'm Japanese). I have been living in Canada for 3 years. The reason why I’m learning interaction design at <a href=https://www.georgebrown.ca>George Brown College</a> is to become a UI/UX designer. I went to <a href="https://www.osaka-geidai.ac.jp/geidai/english/">Osaka university of Arts</a>, and <a href="https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/"> Keio University</a> law school in Japan. But I don’t have carrier for a design industry.(only worked for design jobs as intern and individually) When I was 25, I started to ask myself <em>what do I really want to do in this life.</em> 
      Becoming a designer was my dream when I was small and I decided to leave the last job(It was a transportation company) and learn design again in Canada. Nowadays, digital device has been sprayed with great speed in the world, and users feel happy with a good experience design from websites and mobile apps.</p>
            
      <p class="highlight center-this"><strong>Good designer/Good developer</strong> can answer the high demands and create an incredible idea through the UI and UX, I shifted to become <em>UI/UX designer</em>. For now, learning the theory of user experience is interesting. 
      The reason why I chose Canada to learn design is I am attracted by international cultures, beautiful nature, and warm people. I love meeting new people, trying new things (new technology, trended things, etc). My personality is ambitious and enthusiastic to learn new skills.
